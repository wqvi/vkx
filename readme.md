# VKX
Vulkan Voxel project

## Purpose
A game that draws inspiration from Minecraft and Starbound. Think of it like a 3D starbound or a Minecraft with a builtin advanced rocketry modpack. C++11 is employed due to Starbound's philosophy. Built from the ground up with a singular purpose, to be as good as possible at it's job. The Vulkan rendering API and AMDs Vulkan Memory Allocator library are used for finely tuned graphics to support the mass amounts of voxels needed to be rendered.

#### Libraries used
1. Vulkan Rendering API by Khronos Group
2. Vulkan Memory Allocator (VMA) by AMDs GPU Open
3. GLM by g-truc
4. STB Image by nothings
